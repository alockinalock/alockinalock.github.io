    I'm alockinalock, also known by my real name: Andrew Zhang <br><span class="interjections">(You'd eventually figure that out with one quick visit to my LinkedIn)</span>.

    My online activity is mostly related to programming and video games, the latter of which I happen to occasionally make videos for <br><span class="interjections">(Although my upload schedule is far from desirable)</span>.
    <br>
    Here's a fun fact, this website isn't finished. In fact, far from. You can resize the window you are viewing this website in and many elements will just devolve into chaos.
    <br>
    Plus, anything beyond the first page is just... barebones. Don't worry, it'll probably take me like, a week per page.

    <span class="interjections">(The home page you saw took me 2 weeks actually, not something I'm proud of)</span>
    <br>
    A clear example of this incompetency is these pages. The text here isn't even centered. I'm trying to figure it out ðŸ¥²
